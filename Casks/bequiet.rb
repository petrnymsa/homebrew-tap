  caveats <<~EOS
    BeQuiet is ad-hoc signed (there is no Apple Developer account behind it),
    so Gatekeeper refuses the first launch. Allow it under System Settings →
    Privacy & Security → Open Anyway, or clear the quarantine flag:
      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/BeQuiet.app"
    Browser tabs are paused only after "Allow JavaScript from Apple Events" is
    enabled in Chrome (View → Developer) and Safari (Develop menu).
